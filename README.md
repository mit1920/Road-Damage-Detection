# 🚧 Road Damage Detection using YOLOv8M

## 📝 Overview
This project is designed to detect different types of road damages using a custom YOLOv8M model. The model is trained to detect four types of road damages:

1. *Longitudinal Cracking* 🛣
2. *Lateral Cracking* 🧱
3. *Pothole* 🌪
4. *Alligator Cracking* 🐊

These damages are crucial to identify for effective road maintenance. The project utilizes the YOLOv8M model to detect and classify these damages from images of roads.

Additionally, the model is integrated into a *Streamlit Web Application* that allows users to upload or capture images and view real-time damage detection results. This web interface is simple and user-friendly, making it easy to identify road conditions.

## 🚀 Features
- *Real-time Detection*: Upload or capture road images, and the app will detect and classify damage types.
- *Four Damage Categories: The model detects **Longitudinal Cracking, **Lateral Cracking, **Potholes, and **Alligator Cracking*.
- *Streamlit Interface*: A user-friendly web app for easy interaction with the model.

## 🛠 Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- YOLOv8M model and necessary dependencies
- Streamlit for the web interface
- OpenCV for image handling

You can install the required dependencies by running:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## 🏃‍♂ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/road-damage-detection.git


### 2. Install the dependencies:
Make sure you have installed all necessary libraries by running:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3. Run the Streamlit app:
Once the dependencies are installed, run the Streamlit app using:

bash
streamlit run app.py


### 4. Upload or capture images:
Once the app is running, open it in your browser. You can:
- *Upload an image* of a road.
- *Capture a picture* using your device's camera.
- The app will display the detected damages in the image.

## 💡 How it Works
- *YOLOv8M Model*: The model is trained on images with annotations for each type of damage (Longitudinal Cracking, Lateral Cracking, Pothole, and Alligator Cracking).
- *Detection*: When you upload or capture an image, YOLOv8M will perform object detection to identify the damages in the image.
- *Streamlit Interface*: The app provides a simple way to interact with the model and visualize the results.

## 📊 Results
The Streamlit app displays the detected damages with bounding boxes, labels, and a confidence score. It helps quickly assess the condition of the road based on the detected damage.

## ⚡ Demo
You can interact with the Streamlit app to see how the detection works in real-time! Simply upload a road image, and the model will detect the type of damage. Here is an example of the detection in action:

## 🚧 Road Damage Classes

- *Longitudinal Cracking* 🛣: Cracks that run parallel to the road's length.
- *Lateral Cracking* 🧱: Cracks that run perpendicular to the road's length.
- *Pothole* 🌪: A depression in the road surface caused by wear and tear.
- *Alligator Cracking* 🐊: A pattern of cracks resembling the scales of an alligator, often due to a weakened road foundation.
